# NumericParser
Parses and evaluates numeric expressions

test folder contains both sample tests provided in task's description, and hidden extra tests I added myself.

Make sure to put test folder in the same directory as the executables are.

`main.cpp` will parse and evaluate all tests inside `test/SampleTests.txt` and `test/HiddenTests.txt` files.
